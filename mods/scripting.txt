chroma-fighters mod scripting documentation

this documentation will probably be really bad lmao

check the test fighter info.jsonc for a guide on how that file works for fighters

script files use the .cfs file extension, but are just plain text files you can create with notepad or any other text editor
the game uses hscript (https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/hscript) to interpret haxe code from your script files, but you dont need to care about that if you just want to make something for chroma-fighters
if you are familiar with haxe or hscript you should know how this works and can just use the api documentation

when one of your scripts is called, all of the code inside the file is run from top to bottom.

i need to add more to this lol

misc things you should probably know:
- you cannot create classes or types in scripts due to a limitation with hscript.
- all event functions must accept an `Array<Dynamic>`, instead of each argument listed, and cast each argument.
for example, to add a listener for update(), you must declare a function in your script as
function update(args:Array<Dynamic>) { logDynamic(1/(cast args[0])) }
instead of 
function update(elapsed:Float) { logDynamic(1/args[0]) }
this is due to a limitation of function types, but may be changed in the future
functions that you only intend to call from your own script do not need to be defined this way

basic tutorial:

to get started creating your first fighter mod, copy the template mod from the mods folder. this mod is hidden in game as you arent meant to play as this fighter, but it is a fully functional fighter.
to get the fighter to show up in the custom fightr selection, change the value of the "modFormat" property in the `info.jsonc` file from -1 to the number shown after "Format:" in the top right of the main menu after pressing F3.
once you do that, press F3 + R on the main menu to reload mods, and then go to the custom character selection and you should see it listed.
now its time to make it your own fighter. open the `info.jsonc` file again, and change the author, name, id, description, and tags properties to whatever you want.
if you reload the mods again (F3 + R on the main menu), you should see the changes you made in the character selector.
i wont go into creating art for the character here now as 

API Documentation:

events:
events are functions that you define in your script that will get called by the game when certain things happen
eventName(eventArgument:ArgumentType)

available for all mods:
update(elapsed:Float)
onModLoad()
onModUnload()
onModInit()
onMatchStart()
onMatchEnd()
onTriggerZoneActivate(id:String)


built-in vars documentation:

available for all mods:
matchStarted:Bool - if the match has started, and the countdown is completed

available for fighter mods:
percent:Float - fighter %
airstate:? - idk how this will work yet. the air state of the fighter


built-in functions documentation:
functionName(argumentName:ArgumentType, ?optionalArgument:ArgumentType=defaultValue)

available for all mods:
log(text:String)
logDynamic(...args:Dynamic) // you can log almost any type with this, but how useful that is may vary
createSquareTriggerZone(x:Float, y:Float, width:Float, height:Float, id:String)
createSquareDamageBox(x:Float, y:Float, width:Float, height:Float, id:String, angle:Float, knockback:Float, damage:Float)
createSquareWindBox(x:Float, y:Float, width:Float, height:Float, id:String, angle:Float, speed:Float)
createCircleTriggerZone(x:Float, y:Float, radius:Float, id:String)
createCircleDamageBox(x:Float, y:Float, radius:Float, id:String, angle:Float, knockback:Float, damage:Float)
createCircleWindBox(x:Float, y:Float, radius:Float, id:String, angle:Float, speed:Float)
getClosestFighter(x:Float, y:Float, ?range:Float=-1.0):Null<Fighter>
hasMatchStarted():Bool
hasMatchEnded():Bool
getFighter(slot:Int):Null<Fighter>
getModOptions():Map<String -> Dynamic>
getModOption(key:String):Dynamic
getSprite(key:NamespacedKey, ?frame:Int=0, ?tag:String):BitmapData
drawBitmap(bitmap:BitmapData, x:Float, y:Float)


available for fighter mods, or on the `Fighter` class when refrenced by another mod if $:
$getPercent():Float
$getSlot():Int
$getFighterName():String
$getPlayerName():String
$damage(amount:Float, ?attacker:Int)
stale(id:String)
getStaledDamage(id:String, amount:Float)
$launch(?angle:Float=50, ?knockback:Float=1.0, ?flip:Bool=true) // angle is -360 to 360, 0 is straight up, flip will automatically multiply by -1 if fighter is facing right
$getHeldItem():Null<HoldableItem>

fighter input functions (fighter.input.<function>):
these return the input state of the button they refer to
JUST_PRESSED = the button was pressed this frame
PRESSED = the button is currently being pressed
JUST_RELEASED = the button was released this frame
NOT_PRESSED = the button is not being pressed

getCursorPosition():Position - the x,y position of the cursor on menus
getConfirm(): the button used to confirm in menus, usually con-A or kb-Z
getCancel(): the button used to cancel or go back in menus, usually con-B or kb-X;
getMenuAction(): action button in menus, usually con-X and con-Y or kb-C;
getMenuLeft(): left modifier in menus, usually for selecting alts, usually con-LB/L or kb-A;
getMenuRight(): right modifier in menus, usually for selecting alts, usually con-RB/R or kb-S;

getAttack(): button used to attack
getJump():
getSpecial():
getStrong():
getShield():
getDodge():
getWalk():

input helper (InputHelper.<function>):
these functions accept 1 or more input states and can return a new input state or boolean that may be easier to work with
the 'argument' shown is actually just the number of input states they accept
isPressed(1):Bool
isNotPressed(1):Bool
justChanged(1):Bool
notChanged(1):Bool
or(any):INPUT_STATE
asInt(1):Int

currently only for internal use, but may work in scripts anyways, not sure. probably not, but might add support for something like these in the future
getFromFlixel(justPressed:Bool, justReleased:Bool, pressed:Bool)
getFromFlxInput(input:FlxInput<Int>)
getFromFlxKey(key:FlxKey)
