chroma-fighters mod scripting documentation

this documentation will probably be really bad lmao

check the test fighter info.jsonc for a guide on how that file works for fighters

script files use the .cfs file extension, but are just plain text files you can create with notepad or any other text editor
the game uses hscript (https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/hscript) to run the script files, but you dont need to care about that if you just want to make something for chroma-fighters

when one of your scripts is called, all of the code inside the file is run from top to bottom.

i need to add more to this lol
